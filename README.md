# PollsApp
PollsApp is a simple applicationIt’ll consist of two parts:

    A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
    An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.
    
In this simple poll app, we’ll create two models: Question and Choice.
  A Question has a question and a publication date.
  A Choice has two fields: the text of the choice and a vote tally.
  Each Choice is associated with a Question.
